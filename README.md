A site designed to take notes as I continue to learn programming
    Site will be used to create a cheatsheet for only the most important 
  commands in each language in order to make it functional without
  feeling crowded.

  The style of the site will focus on minimalism as much as possible.
    limiting the use of colors to Black / White with an accent to 
    indicate action 

        #1E1E1E (Drk Gray)        Background
        #484848 (Drk Mid Gray)    Mid-ground    /   table outline
        #8E8E8E (Mid Gray)        Fore-Ground   /   comment
        #F2F2F2 (Soft White)      Highlight     /   text
        #FFBD44 (yellow)          Alt Highlight /   hyperlink

                    [ Optional Colors for Diagrams ]
